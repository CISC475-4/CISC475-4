This project was created by group 4 of the Spring 2015 University of Delaware
Advanced Software Engineering (CISC475) class. It parses datasets into an 
embedded sqlite database, then does transformations on the data before 
rendering it interactively using matplotlib inside of a PySide QT GUI. The 
whole project is written in Python.

For more information, consult the documentation and comments in the source code.
