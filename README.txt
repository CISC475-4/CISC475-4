This project was created by group 4 of the Spring 2015 University of Delaware
Advanced Software Engineering (CISC475) class. It parses datasets into an 
embedded sqlite database, then does transformations on the data before 
rendering it interactively using matplotlib inside of a PySide QT GUI. The 
whole project is written in Python.

For more information, consult the documentation and comments in the source code.

In order to use this application without installing all of the Python libraries on your machine, you will need to set up Vagrant, as instructed in ‘Using_Vagrant.md’

To run the application, double-click on the "run" file in this directory (or in the ‘/vagrant’ directory if using Vagrant), or use the following command in Terminal.app while in the project directory:
    $ /usr/bin/env python2 main.py
