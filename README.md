# CISC475-4
This is the repository for group 4 of the University of Delaware's Spring 2015 Advanced Software Engineering class, working on a data vision project.

Our project parses datasets into an embedded sqlite database, then does transformations on the data before rendering it interactively using matplotlib inside of a PySide QT GUI. The whole project is written in Python.

For more information, consult the documentation and comments in the source code.
